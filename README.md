Hi everyone!

I am a financial services professional who loves to learn. After almost a decade of experience in institutional sales, I am excited to embark on a new journey to acquire new skills and learn about the world of computer science. Let's go brave new world! I love adventure travel, anything encompassing the arts, maintaning an active lifestyle and wine education.
